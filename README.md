# deep-learning-challenge

The purpose of this analysis is to create and train a Neural Network that can take in venture applicants and make predictions on their success using attributes like Government Organization Classification, Income classification, Funding Amount Requested, Sector Affiliation, as well as several others.

The Starter_Code.ipynb is the first attempt at implementing a Deep Learning Model to make predictions of applicant success, and the AlphabetSoupCharity.h5 file is the trained model from Starter_Code.ipynb.

The AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb creates new Deep Learning Models to improve the accuracy of predictions of applicant success, and the AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5 file is the trained model from AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb.
